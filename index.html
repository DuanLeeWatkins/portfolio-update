            <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--about">Software Engineer based out of Maryland</p>

            <div class="about-me__body">
                <p>While in High school, I was always fascinated with the criminal justice system. I used to love
                    watching the show
                    'Criminal Minds'. After High school, I went to college to study criminal justice. When I graduated,
                    I joined a federal
                    agency doing testing. In this position, I was a great team player. I was always offering my time to
                    help my supervisor
                    or coworkers with tasks or troubleshooting problems. My supervisor would always ask me to do
                    specific duties because she
                    could always count on me to complete them promptly. While working for this agency, I always had
                    Penelope, the technical
                    analyst from "Criminal Minds" in the back of my mind. She was always helping the agents solve
                    complicated cases with her
                    computer skills. I wanted to be like Penelope and use my technical skills to help my team achieve a
                    common goal that
                    will help others.</p>
                <p>When I did some research on different tech sub-fields, I found an interest in software engineering.
                    So in my free time,
                    I began developing my software engineering skills. When the pandemic hit, there was less work to do
                    at my agency which,
                    allowed me to focus more on the software engineering skills that I have been developing for some
                    time. I took on some
                    personal projects and open sourcing projects that helped me further my skills using HTML, CSS,
                    JavaScript, MongoDB,
                    Express.js, and Node.js. From what I've learned and created, I enjoyed software engineering which,
                    made me decide to go
                    down this career path instead of going back to testing as things open up. I love the front-end
                    aspect of engineering.
                    Being able to express my creative side while using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) to
                    build
                    clean-looking, accessible, easy-to-navigate web interfaces has always been very fulfilling. I like
                    using JavaScript as
                    the primary language front-end and back-end of an application/webpage because of its simplicity,
                    speed, popularity, and
                    ability to create rich interfaces. Problem-solving has always been one of my exceptional skills. I
                    enjoy the process of
                    problem-solving and the euphoric feeling of finding a solution.</p>

                <p>I would make a great addition to any team within a company. I am dedicated, trustworthy, highly
                    motivated, a team
                    player, dependable, eager to learn more, and passionate to be a part of something great.</p>
